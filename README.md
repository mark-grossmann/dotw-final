# dotw-final
My plan for the final project is to create a series of three pieces to which have to do with surveillance and the creepiness of it. For about a year I’ve realized that all of the cameras around New York just really scare me for no good reason. I wouldn’t consider myself even a private person; However, something about how all of the new LinkNYC boxes have cameras on both sides combined with the fact that there are sometimes multiple LinkNYC boxes on a block, (and that they extend into the outer boroughs as well), really doesn’t jive with me.

For my three pieces I want
one to be a concrete view - processing the live stream from https://www.earthcam.com/usa/newyork/timessquare/?cam=tsstreet in three js. I want the user to be able to interact with the stream. In my first draft, I’ve gotten this live stream onto a three-js plane. Now all I have to do is the more artistic part of actually processing it.

A second piece to be abstract and focus on communicating the anxiety that surveillance gives me (probably using Canvas, images, and the web audio api)

And finally a third piece that sits in between these two abstract and literal representations – a heavier processing of a past streams that I recorded back in mid 2019 and just back in Febuary.
